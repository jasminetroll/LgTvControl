[The Gin and Tonic License][phk]
--------------------------

As long as you retain this notice, you can do whatever you want
with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff
is worth it, you can buy me a gin and tonic in return.

Cheers,

_It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much
importance to attach, that something like 85 percent of all known
worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have
invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N-N-T’N-ix, or
jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the
same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary
between the Sivolvian “chinanto/mnigs” which is ordinary water served
at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan
“tzjin-anthony-ks” which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact
the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the
names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named_ before
_the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds._

_What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far
as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off
the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very
angry when young structural linguists go on about it. Young structural
linguists get deeply excited about it and stay up late at night
convinced that they are very close to something of profound
importance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their
time, getting very angry with the young ones. Structural linguistics
is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of
its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in
Ouisghian Zodahs._
